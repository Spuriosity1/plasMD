A routine written in C++ for simulating electron dynamics in XFEL-illuminated biomolecules

## Why would anyone want this?
The development of XFEL technology in recent years has lead to an explosion of interest in the imaging of radiation-sensitive biomolecules by ultrashort femtosecond pulses of hard X-ray radiation.
